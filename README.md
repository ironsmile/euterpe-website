# Euterpe Website

This is the source for the Euterpe Media player website. It is
created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the
[Syna Thme](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/syna/).

## Running Locally

To run the website locally just rune

```
hugo server -D
```

Any file changes made will be immediately visible on the
local instance.

## Hugo Version

Currently this website requires Hugo `v0.80.0` to work because of few bugs in the Syna Theme:

* [Syna Issue #851](https://github.com/okkur/syna/issues/851)
* [Syna Issue #848](https://github.com/okkur/syna/issues/848)

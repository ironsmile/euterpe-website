Euterpe itself comes with a built-in web UI which could be used for listening to your music. It supports searching, browsing and filtering. For users of macOS and Chromium it even fully supports the OS media shortcuts.

The web UI also gives you a convenient way of connecting other devices which support QR code scanning.

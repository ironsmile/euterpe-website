This is a convergent desktop and mobile client. It is developed with mobile Linux environments in mind. Such as [Phosh](https://developer.puri.sm/Librem5/Software_Reference/Environments/Phosh.html) and [Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/). But it is completely usable as a normal desktop application as well.

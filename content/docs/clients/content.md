Euterpe is a client-server software. The server indexes the music files, provides APIs for interaction and serves the actual music files. While the clients are the actual pieces of software which play the music on your devices.

There is a built-in web UI which comes with every installtion. One could used via any modern web browser with audio playback support. There are multiple other clients which could be used to play music via your Euterpe instance. Head over to the [Clients page](/clients) for selection of them.
